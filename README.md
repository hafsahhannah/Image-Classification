# Image classification using MobileNet

## Description

There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which 
usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which 
occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of 
concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isnâ€™t compacted properly as 
well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. 
Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not eing 
identified quickly and left untreated.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* numpy
* MobileNetv2
* tensorflow
* pandas

### Installing

* You can run on colab or Python
* Data can be obtained from
https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2


## Info

### I'm using transfer learning and the concept of classification layer to classify these images and managed to get an average accuracy of 98%.
